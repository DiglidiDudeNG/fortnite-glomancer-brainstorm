# Fortnite Class Idea: The Glomancers

## Goals

- Fix the bluglo problem, where it is barely useful aside from activating main objectives or gettings 2min buffs (which barely anybody get anyway).
- Integrate a unique, Elemental-based Spellcaster archetype.
- Refrain from going too Warcraft-y; Stay lore-friendly.
- Refrain from having abilities too similar from the ones already available on other classes.

## Lore

A few years after the first husk invasion, some survivors from different shelters got suddenly drawn by the idea of bluglo, beside never having seen it. However, the stories told by the heroes who ventured in the wild in search of that mysterious sky-colored, non-euclidian matter, made those survivors want to find it, as if their body needed it.

Soon, they started leaving the shelters sneakily while no one was looking, in hopes of finding a wild bluglo and sate this instinctual desire. Some perished during their hunt, however, those who found actual bluglo quickly found out how dangerously powerful they became as they consumed it. 

They found out the bluglo allowed them to use powers that were thought to only exist in fantasy novels. They could channel destructive forces, summon husks to do their biding, and perform rituals to protect their allies against the storm's minions. The ones who were able to go further in their understanding of their power became teachers for the lesser talented. They soon had their own headquarters, their own uniform, they could call eachother family, belonging to a blooming culture.

They were known as **The Glomancers**.

## How it came to be

I had this idea while I was going to sleep one night. I was wondering what kind of new class could make Fortnite more interesting and wasn't done already. The only one I had in mind was someone who would be magelike, someone who cast spells and used supernatural forces, but that sounded waaaay out of the realm of what's lore-friendly for this game. But then I thought "This game has glowing blue goo, zombies that have laser eyes and ghosts. Maybe this doesn't seem too farfetched..."

So this is what I have so far. I want this to be a community effort, because this idea can only gain traction if we can all agree with our ideas. I've started writing about possible spells, and will have concept art going sooner or later in the coming weeks.

Just be aware that the numbers are nowhere near final. Don't take them for granted, just take them as an example, because they most likely aren't balanced.

## Main Mechanics

### Glo-charges

This class uses bluglo as a way to empower itself. They gain a 4th bar under the stamina bar, named the "Glo-gauge" *(not final name)*, which is the gauge they spend to use their abilities. To compensate from not using stamina for abilities, their maximum stamina gets cut by half.

At the beginning of a map, they start with 0 maximum charge.
Collecting bluglo naturally in the ingame world increases their maximum glo-charge *(not final name)* capacity by one. 
Getting bluglo from other players who drop theirs does not grant them more maximum charge, since the bluglo's energy was already tainted from being held by someone else.
They regenerate charge naturally as long as they have at least 1 on their maximum glo-charge, but it is slower than regenerating stamina.
Each maximum glo-charge also increases their base regeneration rate by a small percent, say 5%.
Some spells use more glo-charges than others.

### Abilities

Here are some of the abilities that could be used by them.

#### 1) Summon Lesser Husks

Summons 5 normal-sized husks to attack enemy husks for a few seconds. The attacked husks will change their target to the summoned husks until they die or expire.

This is the most important skill that will be the most often present in the array of sub-classes available. In other words, it's the main gimmick. Some classes could even be able to unlock elemental husks when leveled up, with added benefits that fit said element.

The husks will have a blue glow (bluglo, get it?) around them to show that they're allied husks.

#### 2) Violent Breeze

Pushes a group of husks to each side in front of you, by 2 tiles.

This ability could be used as a way to divert the husks off a cliff, forcing them to walk back up the hill or find another way to reach their target. You don't kill them, but you delay them long enough for them not to bother you until they come back.

#### 3) Protective Ward

Protects an ally from damage, reducing any damage they take by 25% for a limited amount of time.

You can guess this will help melee-based classes to stay alive as they charge on towards bees or special husks, but it's there also because there's no other class that does this sort of thing from the get-go.

#### 4) Teleport to ally

Teleports the user next to a visible teammate in view range.

While you might think this sounds unbalanced, remember that this takes one ability slot, so there are only two other abilities that can be available for that hero if you have this ability which does not help fighting enemies, but makes the user able to survive easier and keep up with their teammates while exploring, because remember, you have less stamina than everyone else.

#### 5) Elemental Storm

Create an elemental storm affecting everything in 1 tile for a short time.

Just your basic damage spell, because I realized there aren't much for this class so far. Could use more elaboration on that one.

#### ...And more!

Please propose any other abilities you think would work well with this class!

### Squad Bonuses

#### Support Bonuses

- Increase elemental damage resistance by 30%
- Reduce ability cooldown length by 25%

#### Unique Tactical Bonuses

- Summon 2 more husks.

## Look/Design

Think of a hybrid of stereotypical witches (colored stripes leggings, boots, fluffy dress, pointy hat) with a lot of gothic clothings (long fingerless gloves, corset, chocker, etc.) A combination of both could work really well.
